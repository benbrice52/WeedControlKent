            <h3 class="faq-question">How often should commercial properties be treated for weeds?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The ideal treatment frequency depends on your property type and requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High-visibility sites (retail parks, business parks):</strong> Quarterly treatments (4 times per year) maintain consistently weed-free appearance</li>
                    <li><strong>Industrial estates and car parks:</strong> 2-3 treatments per year typically sufficient for good weed control</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower-traffic areas:</strong> Annual or bi-annual treatments may be adequate</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem areas:</strong> Initial intensive treatment followed by regular maintenance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We typically recommend quarterly treatments for most commercial properties as this provides year-round control and is more cost-effective than reactive one-off treatments.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question">What herbicides do you use and are they safe?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>We use only professional-grade, HSE-approved herbicides that are licensed for commercial use in the UK. Our most common treatments include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Glyphosate-based products:</strong> Total weed control for hard surfaces</li>

            <h3 class="faq-question">How long does weed control treatment last?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Treatment effectiveness varies depending on the product used and site conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visible results:</strong> Weeds typically start dying within 7-14 days</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete kill:</strong> Full treatment effect achieved within 3-4 weeks</li>
                    <li><strong>Residual protection:</strong> Residual herbicides provide 8-16 weeks of protection against new growth</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance timing:</strong> Follow-up treatments recommended before residual protection expires</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Annual contracts with quarterly treatments ensure continuous weed control year-round, preventing weed establishment rather than constantly fighting mature growth.</p>

                <p>Yes! We regularly work on operational sites with minimal disruption to your business:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexible scheduling:</strong> Early morning, evenings, or weekend treatments available</li>

                    <li><strong>Quick drying:</strong> Most herbicides dry within 2-4 hours in normal conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> We work with your team to schedule around deliveries, events, or peak times</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="faq-question">What happens if weeds return after treatment?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Some weed regrowth between treatments is normal, particularly in high-pressure areas or during peak growing season. However:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Annual contracts:</strong> Include scheduled follow-up treatments to maintain continuous control</li>
                    <li><strong>Treatment guarantee:</strong> If significant regrowth occurs within 8 weeks of treatment (under normal conditions), we'll reassess at no additional charge</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonal variation:</strong> Spring and early summer see most aggressive weed growth; autumn/winter treatments provide longer-lasting control</li>
                    <li><strong>Site factors:</strong> Heavy trafficking, drainage issues, or seed pressure from adjacent areas can increase regrowth rates</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Regular maintenance programs provide far better long-term control and value than reactive one-off treatments.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3 class="faq-question">What's the difference between BALI accredited and non-accredited contractors?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>BALI (British Association of Landscape Industries) accreditation is the gold standard for landscaping and grounds maintenance contractors. Accredited companies must demonstrate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Professional qualifications:</strong> Verified operator certifications and training</li>
                    <li><strong>Insurance standards:</strong> Minimum £5M public liability and appropriate professional indemnity</li>
                    <li><strong>Health & safety compliance:</strong> Documented H&S systems and regular audits</li>
                    <li><strong>Business standards:</strong> Financial stability, professional conduct, and customer service commitments</li>
                    <li><strong>Environmental responsibility:</strong> Commitment to sustainable practices and environmental protection</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual assessment:</strong> Ongoing compliance reviews and standards maintenance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Non-accredited contractors may lack formal qualifications, appropriate insurance, or professional standards oversight. BALI accreditation provides peace of mind that you're working with a vetted, professional service provider.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Our pricing is based on several factors to ensure fair, accurate quotes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Area size:</strong> Total square meters of surface requiring treatment</li>
                    <li><strong>Site complexity:</strong> Access restrictions, number of separate areas, obstacles</li>
                    <li><strong>Weed severity:</strong> Light maintenance vs. heavy infestation requiring intensive treatment</li>
                    <li><strong>Surface types:</strong> Tarmac, concrete, block paving, gravel - different surfaces may need different approaches</li>
                    <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> One-off treatments vs. annual contracts (contracts offer 20-30% savings)</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Travel time from our Chatham base</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We provide free, no-obligation quotes based on site surveys or aerial imagery assessment. All quotes are fixed-price with no hidden costs - the price we quote is the price you pay.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question">Do you offer annual contracts or just one-off treatments?</h3>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>We offer both options, though annual contracts provide significantly better value:</p>
                <p><strong>Annual Contracts:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed price for entire year (budget certainty)</li>
                    <li>Scheduled quarterly treatments (4 visits per year)</li>
                    <li>20-30% savings compared to four individual one-off treatments</li>
                    <li>Priority scheduling and emergency callout availability</li>
                    <li>Continuous weed control year-round</li>
                    <li>Simplified administration (one contract, one invoice schedule)</li>

                <p><strong>One-Off Treatments:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suitable for occasional maintenance or trying our service</li>
                    <li>Pay per treatment</li>
                    <li>No ongoing commitment</li>
                    <li>Quoted individually per site visit</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Rough Estimates (Phone or Email):</strong></p>

                    <li>Requires approximate square meters or car park spaces</li>
                    <li>Not binding - accurate quote needs site assessment</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Accurate Quotes (Site Visit or Aerial Imagery):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Precise measurements of treatment areas</li>
                    <li>Assessment of site complexity and access</li>
                    <li>Identification of sensitive areas requiring special attention</li>
                    <li>Fixed-price binding quote valid for 30 days</li>
                    <li>Can often be done from aerial imagery (Google Maps) for straightforward sites</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For smaller straightforward sites, we can often provide accurate quotes from aerial imagery without needing a site visit, saving everyone time.</p>
